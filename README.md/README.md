This Project is built using HTML, CSS, and JS. It is a very simple UI and it allows the users to select the sorting algorithm like Bubble
Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort can be easily understood by visualizing and select the array size, and
speed of the visualization.
speed of the visualization. This project provide you step by step to complete information about sorting algorithm and core part of javascript.

# Pre-requisites
Code Editor -> I Prefer VSCode to Built this Project
HTML -> Using HTML to Develop the Basic site Structure.
CSS -> Using CSS to make the design and style all the things of website through CSS.
JAVASCRIPT -> Using javaScript to implement the core functionality of website and all the sorting algorithm is also implemented.

# Reason 
The main resson make this project to become more familier with the concept of sorting algorithm. So i did'nt use any frameworks other than HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
That's why i am making this project to let everyone understand how these algorithms work and through this project you also will get a deep understanding of such sorting algorithms.

# What's inside this Project
In this project Currently available sorting algorithms- Bubble sort, Selection sort, Insertion sort, Merge sort, Quicksort. After that You can create new size of array 
and change the speed of the visualization, and visualize how different types of sorting works.

# Challenges I faced Making this Project
Writing sort algorithms in JavaScript. When I want to write some code or learn algorithms for solving coding problems, I usually prefer C/C++ language. Initially, I took more time to implement the first sort algorithm i.e. Bubble sort to perfectly work. After that, for the remaining algorithms, I took no time and implemented them so quickly one after the other. So I faced this problem in my project. But after watching some JavaScript tutorials i cleared my concept that how to write code in JavaScript.
